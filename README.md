# Baby Formula APP


During the past years, before and after the pandemic, parents have had problems locating their baby formula. For many of us, it has been very difficult to buy, track, and locate the baby's formula that our children need.
I am a mother of three children. I live in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys. For most of the mothers in town, it has been very difficult and stressful to buy formulas that are not very popular because they support different needs of the baby's digestive system, and the ones that are popular in the market, like Similac and Enfamil, have been almost impossible to buy in town.
 Having a resource to make the search where you can see all the quantity amounts of every store in the zip code that the user needs will help the user have a better day and will solve the problem easily without looking into every app that each store has, like Walmart and Target, and every grocery store. This app will be a time saver.
I had difficulties during the development process with the deployment and the database as a whole. Fixing certain coding and stylistic problems was particularly challenging. 
Up to the very last minute, my local server displayed my home page with the padding and title looking OK, but the live website had issues. 
Another issue I was unable to resolve was my footer. I have attempted every solution known to man and will continue to try to determine why it is not scrolling to the bottom of the page. 
Aside from that, I think the baby app is serving its function, and it gives me tremendous joy to see an idea that is opening up new possibilities for the future. Thank you!
